# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Kuartet
Kuartet is a childhood card game. Simply collect 4 same card type by select a card in own hand or draw a from draw pile. The one who have the most same card type is the winner.
Since this is a childhood game, i forgot a bit about the rules, so it may not be similar to the actual rules. But still have same goal.
In this version, you will play againts three simple bots.
